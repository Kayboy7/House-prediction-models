# House-prediction-models
## Project Overview
  - Imagine a home buyer describing their dream house—they might focus on the number of 
    bedrooms or the beautiful yard. However, as you’ll discover in this project, many factors 
    can influence a home's price beyond just its visible features. With a dataset containing 79 
    variables that describe nearly every aspect of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, your 
    challenge will be to predict the final sale price of each home.
## This project will give you hands-on experience in:
  • Creative Feature Engineering: Identifying and creating new features that could 
  improve your model’s performance.
  • Advanced Regression Techniques: Implementing and tuning models such as 
  Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to make accurate predictions
